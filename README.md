This is my personal website.

I thought the idea of a command line in the browser would be fun 
and it had been a while since I had done any pure front end development.
The site isn't very mobile friendly but should work on most  
browsers ~~except Internet Explorer (Edge works though)~~ including Internet Explorer. 

If you have any suggestions, let me know!
