This is my personal website.

I thought the idea of a command line in the browser would be fun 
and it had been a while since I had done any pure front end development.
The site isn't very mobile friendly but should work on most desktop 
browsers except Internet Explorer (Edge works though). 

If you have any suggestions, let me know!
